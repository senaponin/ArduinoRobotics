#### current homework assignment

+ Organize your robot code to use functions, as I started to do in class. Your functions should perform the basic capabilities of your robot (or whichever ones you use: goForward(), goBackwards(), turnRight(), stopMoving(), etc. Place your file(s) in Github.

+ This exercise is to develop your skill using servo motors. Use two light sensors pointing in different directions. Write a program so that your servo motor points in the direction that has more light. When the light level is equal, the servo motor should point in the middle. Place your file(s) in Github.

#### Advanced challenge: The servo motor points to the middle when the difference between the two light levels is less than 15.

+Start thinking about the final machine you would like to build for this class. You will present your ideas informally on Friday. Make a folder in your Github account called "FinalProject" and put any description, sketches, research, etc. in there.
