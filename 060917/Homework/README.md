+ Write a function that takes three integer arguments and returns their average. Write a program that uses this function. Review the function resources if necessary.

+ Read all of the resources on [arrays](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#arrays)

+ Use fritzing to create a schematic showing two light sensors and a servo motor. I am only interested in the schematic view, you do not need to do the breadboard or the PCB views. Upload an image to Github.

+ Write a short description of your final project proposal. If you have no ideas don't do this exercise and instead make an appointment to talk to me.





###### Project Proposal:

+ Proposal: 
This Final Project will be connected to WEAR-Tech class. I am thinking of creating a garment/cape that have peacock like attributes or when full expanded resemble that of an orchid. The garment will full expand out. I will be using AC motors to control the opening out of the petals/garment as well as using pumps to create the hugging motion for the soft robotic parts. [See link here](http://bel.reading.ac.uk/low-cost-electronic-circuit-for-soft-robots/)

+ Sensors:
The sensors I'm thinking of using is distance sensor as well as pressure sensor because our team is deciding to have the cape open up when someone comes closer but then wrap around the person when they start to hug each other. In the same way sundews catch their preyt [see link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9NnctZVrvk)

The motion will try to evoke intimacy between the person wearing this garment & the person they are hugging.
