+ Write a function that takes three integer arguments and returns their average. Write a program that uses this function. Review the function resources if necessary.

+ Read all of the resources on arrays

+ Use fritzing to create a schematic showing two light sensors and a servo motor. I am only interested in the schematic view, you do not need to do the breadboard or the PCB views. Upload an image to Github.

+ Write a short description of your final project proposal. If you have no ideas don't do this exercise and instead make an appointment to talk to me.
