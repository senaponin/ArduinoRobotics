# HW 1 - Optional 2 LED
## May 24, 2017

/*
  Blink
  Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO 
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino model, check
  the Technical Specs of your board  at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products
  
  This example code is in the public domain.

  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.

  pinMode(10, OUTPUT); //Don't forget to put pinMode or else it will be very dim lighting.
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever. Change this to alter the blinking patterns.
void loop() {

  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(11, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
