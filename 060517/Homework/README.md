#### Homework

+ Read the three resources about functions [here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#functions)
+ Add the distance measuring sensor to your robot, and write a program to help your robot avoid obstacles. Document as before (picture, video, code with excellent comments). Also describe (in README.md or another .md file) any difficulties you encountered and how you overcame them, and anything interesting you discovered.

#### Advanced challenge:
+ Mount the distance measuring sensor on the servo motor. Use some sort of extension to the pins, do not solder wires to the pins
+ Write a program to make your robot go in the direction where there is the most space.
+ Document as before (picture, video, code with excellent comments, and discussion (in README.md or other .md file)).
+ As a treat, here is an example of what you can do with two servo motors (and a Theremin)
